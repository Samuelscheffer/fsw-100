        <p>This page is dedicated to my big brother, Scott Scheffer. He has always been there for me and has been everything a big brother is supposed to be. Just recently due to the effects of COVID-19 and its ravaging effects on the airplane business, my brother lost his job out of the blue. So many americans are in the same position as he found himself. My brother has always had a passion for smoking meats and just cooking and general. Every night no matter how busy his famalies schedule, you can guarantee that you will find them gathered around the dinner table as a family. Food does many things but most of all, it unites us.Because my brother has such a passion for cooking, it shows up on every plate he touches. He's an honest man as weel. so if theres something you dont like, you can bet that he will make it right.
